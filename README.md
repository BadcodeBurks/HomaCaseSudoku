# Homa Case Study: Sudoku

Goal of this case is to evaluate my development abilities on UI, Feedback, Animation and Feeling.
Sadly a few things have gone sideways.

1. I used only UI elements to make the visuals of the project. I can't really pinpoint where I got the idea but sudoku and UI rects felt optimal in the planning stage, which really hardened the development of the animation side of this project.
2. Having programmed sudoku before, to have a challenge I started the project with a cellular event listener approach, Which later on caused some complexity in the readability and job division of this project.
3. I did not see a specification about whether I was allowed to use external packages or previously written code. This resulted in plenty of spagetti/unoptimized/intertwined code that got some of the job done.

If I worked on this project as a full time job, 
1. in the long run I would try to turn game, level, theme and input managers into wider use packages for other projects.
2. I would definitely use or make a tweening utility package for a more optimized and easily understandable UI animation and effects.
3. I would keep a ready to use generic icons and sprites package for faster visual confirmation during prototyping.
4. I wouldn't rush game logic like I did in this project, due to the time limit and motion/animation priority in the case file.
5. I would NOT do it with UI elements only. 

This project took about 30-35 hours of develoment and a few hours of sudoku solving on the example apps in total and it was a challenging case for me because of my previous inexperience with Unity UI and rects.
